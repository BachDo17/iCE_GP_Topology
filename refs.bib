abstract = {Reliability-based optimization (RBO) offers the possibility of finding the best design for a system according to a prescribed criterion while explicitly taking into account the effects of uncertainty. Although the importance and usefulness of RBO is undisputed, it is rarely applied to practical problems, as the associated numerical efforts are usually extremely large due to the necessity of solving simultaneously a reliability problem nested in an optimization procedure. To alleviate this issue, this contribution proposes an approach for solving a particular class of problems in RBO: the minimization of the failure probability of a linear system subjected to an uncertain load. The main characteristic of this approach is that it is fully decoupled. That is, the solution of the RBO problem is reduced to the solution of a single deterministic optimization problem followed by a single reliability analysis. Such an approach implies a complete change of paradigm with respect to the more classical double-loop and sequential methods for RBO. The theoretical basis for the proposed approach lies in the application of the operator norm theorem. The application and capabilities of the proposed approach are illustrated by means of three examples.}

abstract = {The objective of this study is to propose a relatively simple and efficient method for reliability based topology optimization for structures made of elasto-plastic material. The process of determining the optimal topology of elasto-perfectly plastic structures is associated with the removal of material from the structure. Such a process leads to weakening of structural strength and stiffness causing at the same time increase the likelihood of structural failure. An important aspect of engineering design is to track this probability during the optimization process and not allow the structure safety to exceed a certain level specified by the designer. The purpose of this work is to combine the previously developed yield-limited topology optimization method with reliability analysis using first order approach. Effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on benchmark problems proposed by Rozvany and Maute, and the elasto-plastic topology design of L-shape structure which is frequently used in different approaches for stress constrained topology optimization.}

Since the MCC method is inefficient for convex performance measure functions, a hybrid chaos control (HCC) method is also proposed by employing the AMV method or the MCC method adaptively during the RBDO process.

abstract = {The classical reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) methods, due to the ever increasing complexity of designs and contingent engineering situations, incur more and more intricate numerical models. The consequent intractable computational intensity has imposed great challenges for practical application of RBDO. Thus, the surrogate-based RBDO methods, and especially those using Kriging model, have received widespread attention recently for their superior computational efficiency without compromise of computational accuracy. On the other hand, the Kriging-based RBDO methods still ensue high computational demands for complex RBDO problems and especially those with implicit objective and constraint functions. To enhance the computational efficiency of the Kriging-based RBDO methods, this study proposes an efficient local adaptive Kriging approximation method with single-loop strategy (LAKAM-SLS), in which Kriging models are employed to replace both the objective and constraint functions. Two different criteria are developed to identify whether Kriging model of performance function in probability constraint is active in each iteration. If the criterion is satisfied, approximate inverse most probable point (IMPP) derived by combining sing-loop approach with Kriging will be used to refine the corresponding Kriging model. For the objective function, its Kriging model is sequentially refined through points selected by a newly proposed learning function from the sample pool generated by taking the optimal solution from each iteration as the sampling center. Four benchmark examples and an application example of head pressure shell are implemented to evaluate the computational performance of the currently proposed LAKAM-SLS against other Kriging-based RBDO methods. The result comparison shows that the currently proposed LAKAM-SLS substantially reduces the computational expense to a relatively low level.}

However, it may produce unstable results or increase computational efforts when using the ordinary search direction to determine the optimum design in RBDO problems with highly nonlinear probabilistic constraints. The conjugate gradient (CG) is a promising sensitivity vector for locating the most probable point (MPP) of highly nonlinear concave performance functions. However, the MPP computation using the CG may require a high computational burden for convex constraints To overcome the drawbacks of the SLA the adaptive conjugate single-loop approach (AC-SLA) is proposed for RBDO problems with a large variety of nonlinear constraints. The sensitivity vector of the probabilistic constraints is adaptively computed using the CG vector with a dynamical conjugate scalar factor (DCF). The DCF is adjusted within the range from 0 to 2 using two adaptive coefficients, which are adapted based on the new and previous points. Moreover, the Lyapunov exponents are developed as a general tool for detecting the robustness of different MPP approximation algorithms. The method is also applied to solve a reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) problem. The ability of the AC-SLA in six RBDO benchmark problems, one applicable to an RBDO aircraft engineering problem and one for RBTO problem, is compared in terms of both robustness and efficiency using the SLA, performance measure approach (PMA), reliability index approach (RIA), and sequential optimization and reliability assessment (SORA). The numerical experiments demonstrate that the convergence capability of the proposed AC-SLA is significantly superior to the PMA, RIA, and SORA. The computational effort of the AC-SLA is significantly reduced, with stable results.}

In this paper, a hybrid descent mean value (HDMV) approach is proposed based on a novel merit function, which is applied to combine the MPTP search formulas of the descent mean value (DMV) and advanced mean value (AMV). The merit function is used to adaptively control the numerical instability of the inverse reliability analysis for RBDO-based PMA. The accuracy, robustness and efficiency of the proposed DMV and HDMV methods are compared with existing methods through four nonlinear performance functions, two structural RBDO problems and a complex aircraft panel problem. The results illustrate that the DMV and HDMV methods are more robust, efficient and accurate than existing reliability methods. For the aircraft panel problem, a simultaneous buckling pattern is finally achieved by the proposed methods with better performance in terms of both convergence rate and computational efficiency.}

The method works by generating uniformly distributed samples in a design space for all random variables and applying the probability density value as a weight index at any sample. The result is a simple approximation of the probability of failure without any limitation becoming feasible. The probability of failure is defined as the ratio of the sum of the weight indices in the failure domain over the sum of the indices in the entire domain. High accuracy in estimating small values of the probability of failure as well as the need for few samples are advantages of this method. Moreover, the possibility of estimating the point and the region with the highest failure probability for different types of limit state functions can be considered as another important advantage of the proposed method. The efficiency and robustness of the method are investigated by solving several examples. The results are compared with the results of common reliability methods, and they demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.}

abstract = {Heavy computational burden has been one of the largest barriers to the application of reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) in real-world structures. The key difficulty of RBDO lies in how to perform reliability analysis efficiently and robustly. In performance measure approach (PMA)-based RBDO, the reliability analysis process searches for the minimum performance target point (MPTP) with the target reliability index in standard normal space. Many methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency and robustness of the PMA. However, these methods may face the convergence problem for highly nonlinear constraint functions; or high computational cost for weakly nonlinear ones. More importantly, most existing methods are very sensitive to the selection of algorithm parameters. In this paper, an augmented step size adjustment (ASSA) method is proposed to boost the iterative process in terms of both efficiency and robustness. According to the relative positions of the direction vector and negative gradient direction and the angle between them at each iterative point, a fire-new strategy is established to identify the oscillation during the iterative process and define the iterative step size. Seven inverse reliability analysis problems and three RBDO benchmarks are used to validate the performance of the ASSA method. The results indicate that the ASSA method has wide applicability for nonlinear constraint functions and achieves efficient and robust performance. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the ASSA method can be regarded as a reliable and effective method for addressing PMA-based RBDO problems.}

In the case of probabilistic analysis, relevant parameters such as volume fraction (including manufacturing imprecisions), material properties, and geometrical imperfections (for stability calculations) are assumed to be random variables that follow a normal distribution to represent the uncertainties.

In this regard, the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the analytical topology optimization coupled with reliability analysis are the main efforts for reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) of continuous structures. In the present investigation, a hybrid RBTO approach is developed for robust iterative formulation of reliability loop and an effective and simple optimization approach for topology loop. A multi-level set analytical framework is proposed based on the performance measure approach to seek the optimum results under multi uncertainties in size, mechanical properties, and loads of structures. The considered topology optimization procedure to derive the optimal layout of the structure which is called moving iso-surface threshold (MIST) is a powerful and enhanced topology optimization method in which, unlike other optimization methods, it has the capability of having no direct sensitivity analysis making it easier and simple. The accelerated first-order reliability method is introduced for searching the most probability points in the reliability loop of the RBTO model. The proposed reliability method is developed based on a stable iterative formulation. For reducing the computational burden of the topology optimization loop, the machine learning approach given from the support vector regression (SVR) is applied for estimating the probabilistic constraints in the RBTO model. Four examples of 2D, and 3D compliance, 2D complaint mechanism problem, and frequency maximization are presented for validation and highlighting the abilities in having the most accuracy and safety levels of the proposed hybrid framework named SVR-TO-APMA. The results indicate that the hyperparameters of SVR are directly affected by the accuracy of RBTO results. The stability of the RBTO model is shown by the accelerated PMA and the optimum layout is different from topology optimization in comparison with the RBTO results for 3D compliance and frequency maximization problems. The optimum design with uncertainties is increased by about 40%–90% with a reliability index of 3 compared to TO results for the studied example.}

In order to avoid crude Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS), a widely-adopted approximation technique is the First-Order Reliability Method (FORM). Despite being simple in its implementation, FORM necessitates a nested non-linear optimization, which requires considerable computational resources for several stochastic parameters. The contribution of this paper is the development of a novel approach for quantifying multiple material uncertainties in RBTO using random matrix theory (RMT), whereby uncertainty in Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and thickness are all encapsulated within a random stiffness matrix. Two algorithms are introduced, RMT and RMT–FORM, which are compared to MCS and FORM in terms of quality of the derived topology and computational complexity. Two numerical benchmark TO problems are studied, where the objective is to minimize volume, while satisfying a probabilistic compliance constraint. It is shown that RMT–FORM serves as an excellent replacement for FORM, while being considerably more computationally efficient for RBTO problems. The paper also demonstrates how the accuracy and efficiency of a first-order approximation scales with the amount of uncertainty in the problem.}

abstract = {In practical applications, some random variables follow multimodal distributions. However, conventional reliability analysis methods in reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO), such as the first order reliability method, often result in considerable computational errors when dealing with problems involving multimodal distributions. Consequently, the corresponding RBTO design is incredible. Moreover, the RBTO problem also faces the challenge of high computational cost. To this end, this paper proposes an efficient two-phase approach for RBTO of continuum structures with multimodal distributions combining sequential approximate integer programming with trust region (SAIP-TR) and direct probability integral method (DPIM). Firstly, DPIM is advanced to address the difficult problems of failure probability estimation and efficient sensitivity analysis under multimodal distributions. Secondly, a reliability-based discrete variable topology optimization framework based on SAIP-TR and DPIM is established, which yields clear topology configurations and facilitates engineering manufacturing. Owing to the merit of SAIP-TR, the original RBTO process is divided into two phases: the first phase performs deterministic topology optimization, and the second phase focuses on RBTO. Moreover, an adaptive selection strategy of representative points, considering structural compliance as performance function, is devised to further enhance computational efficiency. Finally, several examples illustrate high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach. The multimodal random variable and the random field are employed separately to describe global and local uncertainties in materials. In contrast, the optimized result considering global material uncertainty is more suitable for additive manufacturing. The proposed approach also presents potential in handling complex RBTO problems with random fields.}

abstract = {The conventional topology optimization considering uncertainties is based on the probabilistic model. This paper proposes a new reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) approach for the uncertain structural design based on the fuzzy set model, which can be constructed by expert opinions. The formulation of the proposed RBTO is established as a volume minimization problem under constraints established within the possibility context, termed as failure possibility constraints. The computation for the failure possibility constraints in each optimization loop is a double-loop nested problem. Accordingly, the proposed RBTO is a triple-loop nested problem, which is computationally expensive. To improve the computational efficiency, the target performance approach is introduced to the failure possibility constraints, and thus the triple-loop nested problem is reduced to a double-loop nested problem. To further improve the computational efficiency, the interval perturbation method (IPM) is used to estimate the constraints, thereby the calculation for the constraints in each optimization loop becomes deterministic, and the double-loop nested problem is reduced to an approximate single-loop problem. Numerical results on two examples are presented to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed methods.}

Written from the user's point of view, this book explains in clear language how such approximate probability computations are made, taking readers from the very beginnings to current applications. The core material is presented in chapters 1-6 at an elementary mathematical level. Chapters 7-9 then give a highly readable account of higher-order asymptotic inference. Later chapters address areas where saddlepoint methods have had substantial impact: multivariate testing, stochastic systems and applied probability, bootstrap implementation in the transform domain, and Bayesian computation and inference. No previous background in the area is required. Data examples from real applications demonstrate the practical value of the methods. Ideal for graduate students and researchers in statistics, biostatistics, electrical engineering, econometrics, and applied mathematics, this is both an entry-level text and a valuable reference.},

In order to overcome computational difficulties, many formulations have been recently developed, leading to confusion about what method should be selected for a given application, due to the lack of full-scale comparative studies. In this context, the present paper aims at giving an overview of various RBDO approaches which are tested on a benchmark constituted of four examples using mathematical and finite element models, with different levels of difficulties. The study is focused on the three main approaches, namely the two-level approach, the single loop approach and the decoupled approach; for each category, two RBDO formulations are discussed, implemented and tested for numerical examples. The benchmark study allows us to give comprehensive overview of various approaches, to give clear ideas about their capabilities and limitations, and to draw useful conclusions regarding robustness and numerical performance.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic design, such as reliability-based design and robust design, offers tools for making reliable decisions with the consideration of uncertainty associated with design variables/parameters and simulation models. Since a probabilistic optimization often involves a double-loop procedure for the overall optimization and iterative probabilistic assessment, the computational demand is extremely high. In this paper, the sequential optimization and reliability assessment (SORA) is developed to improve the efficiency of probabilistic optimization. The SORA method employs a single-loop strategy with a serial of cycles of deterministic optimization and reliability assessment. In each cycle, optimization and reliability assessment are decoupled from each other; the reliability assessment is only conducted after the deterministic optimization to verify constraint feasibility under uncertainty. The key to the proposed method is to shift the boundaries of violated constraints (with low reliability) to the feasible direction based on the reliability information obtained in the previous cycle. The design is quickly improved from cycle to cycle and the computational efficiency is improved significantly. Two engineering applications, the reliability-based design for vehicle crashworthiness of side impact and the integrated reliability and robust design of a speed reducer, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SORA method.},

Its main feature is that it allows determining the best design solution (with respect to prescribed criteria) while explicitly considering the unavoidable effects of uncertainty. In general, the application of this methodology is numerically involved, as it implies the simultaneous solution of an optimization problem and also the use of specialized algorithms for quantifying the effects of uncertainties. In view of this fact, several approaches have been developed in the literature for applying this methodology in problems of practical interest. This contribution provides a survey on approaches for performing Reliability-based Optimization, with emphasis on the theoretical foundations and the main assumptions involved. Early approaches as well as the most recently developed methods are covered. In addition, a qualitative comparison is performed in order to provide some general guidelines on the range of applicability on the different approaches discussed in this contribution.},

Random ground acceleration from earthquake motion is adopted to illustrate the stochastic process force. The exact change ranges of natural frequencies, random vibration displacement and stress responses of structures are investigated under the interval analysis framework. Formulations for structural reliability are developed considering the safe boundary and structural random vibration responses as interval parameters. An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, namely randomised lower sequence initialized high-order nonlinear particle swarm optimization algorithm, is employed to capture the better bounds of structural dynamic characteristics, random vibration responses and reliability. Three numerical examples are used to demonstrate the presented method for interval random vibration analysis and reliability assessment of structures. The accuracy of the results obtained by the presented method is verified by the randomised Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation method (QMCSM) and direct Monte Carlo simulation method (MCSM).},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new approach for importance-sampling-based reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) that reuses information from past optimization iterations to reduce computational effort. RBDO is a two-loop process—an uncertainty quantification loop embedded within an optimization loop—that can be computationally prohibitive due to the numerous evaluations of expensive high-fidelity models to estimate the probability of failure in each optimization iteration. In this work, we use the existing information from past optimization iterations to create efficient biasing densities for importance sampling estimates of probability of failure. The method involves two levels of information reuse: (1) reusing the current batch of samples to construct an a posteriori biasing density with optimal parameters, and (2) reusing the a posteriori biasing densities of the designs visited in past optimization iterations to construct the biasing density for the current design. We demonstrate for the RBDO of a benchmark speed reducer problem and a combustion engine problem that the proposed method leads to computational savings in the range of 51% to 76%, compared to building biasing densities with no reuse in each iteration.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel chaotic heterogeneous comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO) method for the simultaneous size and shape design of structures. The heterogeneous CLPSO divides the particles into two explorative and exploitative subpopulations. The exploration performs the global searches for the set of best particles experienced solely within its own subpopulation, whilst the exploitation refines the deep searches learnt from the global best particle over an entire population. In essence, the proposed method maintains a good balance between the global explorative and local exploitative optimization schemes. The global searches within the explorative subpopulation are independent to the exploitative simulations even if the latter scheme prematurely converges to the local swarm position. For both subpopulations, the comprehensive learning approach constructs the particles through a cross-positioning process on the individual variable space and avoids the local optimal pitfall. Moreover, the chaotic logistic map within the exploitative optimization tests the global best particle through the set of diversely generated samples and hence enhances the local search ability. Various enriching techniques, including automatic adaptive (inertial weight and acceleration) parameters with dynamic space reduction, are incorporated to improve the likelihood of finding the optimal solution of practical-scale problems at modest computing efforts. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are illustrated through a number of planar and spatial truss design benchmarks subjected to the challenging nonconvex and/or nonsmooth programs.}

The approach overcomes the challenges associated with local optima pitfalls in processing the mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and hence determines the accurate solutions at modest computing efforts. In essence, the first-phase ESO design incorporates the constraint relaxations to fast eliminate the ineffective (infeasible) sections from initial discrete variable domains. This advantageously provides a significant reduction in the search spaces performed in the second-phase CLPSO scheme. The comprehensive learning technique enhances a standard particle swarm optimization algorithm by enabling the cooperative responses among swarm populations. The learning probability function defines the comprehensive cross-positions between the sets of best particles constructed from the reducing sets of steel sections specified in the preliminary ESO phase leading to the computation of optimal solutions. Various benchmarks (subjected to infinite design combinations) illustrate robustness and accuracy of the proposed design method (viz., generating the smaller number of particles) as compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms.}

To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a latent adaptation-based deep learning approach to enhance the accuracy of deep networks for reliability-based design optimization under data constraint. By collecting training data from a source domain, an autoencoder is first utilized to introduce a meaningful low-dimensional latent space. Then a feedforward neural network is trained to link the original inputs to latent variables. To address the generalization issue, a latent adaptation strategy is proposed to link the latent variables across the target and source domains. A Gaussian process model is then constructed to learn the limit state function for the target domain in the latent space. Monte Carlo simulation is employed for reliability analysis in target domains. The latent adaptation-based deep learning is then integrated with reliability-based design optimization, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through two examples.}

abstract = {A probability density function (PDF)-based performance shift approach (PPSA) is proposed for sequential reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) in this paper, which provides an effective tool for complex engineering design with consideration of uncertainties associated with design variables and simulation models. It converts the double-loop probabilistic optimization into a serial of cycles of reliability assessment and deterministic optimization through a performance shift strategy. The approach further proceeds by calculating the performance shift scalar and then solving a deterministic design optimization at each cycle, and eventually converges to the optimum design solution. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in two main aspects. First, the shift scalar is deducted for each probabilistic constraint in the response space, rather than in the design variable space, through which the violated constraints are moved towards the reliable region and the design solutions are improved progressively. Second, reliability analysis methods that calculate the moments or probability density functions, rather than most probable points or reliability indexes, are able to be integrated in the sequential RBDO framework, through which we could enhance the performance of existing sequential RBDO methods, especially the computational efficiency. Three numerical examples are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the proposed approach is further utilized to perform crashworthiness design of a vehicle side impact problem.}

  abstract = {This paper presents an efficient optimization procedure for solving the reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problem of structures under aleatory uncertainty in material properties and external loads. To reduce the number of structural analysis calls during the optimization process, mixture models of Gaussian processes (MGPs) are constructed for prediction of structural responses. The MGP is used to expand the application of the Gaussian process model (GPM) to large training sets for well covering the input variable space, significantly reducing the training time, and improving the overall accuracy of the regression models. A large training set of the input variables and associated structural responses is first generated and split into independent subsets of similar training samples using the Gaussian mixture model clustering method. The GPM for each subset is then developed to produce a set of independent GPMs that together define the MGP as their weighted average. The weight vector computed for a specified input variable contains the probability that the input variable belongs to the projection of each subset onto the input variable space. To calculate the failure probabilities and their inverse values required during the process of solving the RBDO problem, a novel saddlepoint approximation is proposed based on the first three cumulants of random variables. The original RBDO problem is replaced by a sequential deterministic optimization (SDO) problem in which the MGPs serve as surrogates for the limit-state functions in probabilistic constraints of the RBDO problem. The SDO problem is strategically solved for exploring a promising region that may contain the optimal solution, improving the accuracy of the MGPs in that region, and producing a reliable solution. Two design examples of a truss and a steel frame demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization procedure.},

abstract = {The computation of the probability of a rare (failure) event is a common task in structural reliability analysis. In most applications, the numerical model defining the rare event is nonlinear and the resulting failure domain often multimodal. One strategy for estimating the probability of failure in this context is the importance sampling method. The efficiency of importance sampling depends on the choice of the importance sampling density. A near-optimal sampling density can be found through application of the cross entropy method. The cross entropy method is an adaptive sampling approach that determines the sampling density through minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the theoretically optimal importance sampling density and a chosen parametric family of distributions. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of the multivariate normal distribution and the Gaussian mixture model as importance sampling densities within the cross entropy method. Moreover, we compare the performance of the cross entropy method to sequential importance sampling, another recently proposed adaptive sampling approach, which uses the Gaussian mixture distribution as a proposal distribution within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. For the parameter updating of the Gaussian mixture within the cross entropy method, we propose a modified version of the expectation-maximization algorithm that works with weighted samples. To estimate the number of distributions in the mixture, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is adapted to the use of weighted samples. We compare the performance of the different methods in several examples, including component reliability problems, system reliability problems and reliability in varying dimensions. The results show that the cross entropy method using a single Gaussian outperforms the cross entropy method using Gaussian mixture and that both distribution types are not suitable for high dimensional reliability problems.}

abstract = {In many contexts, it is of interest to assess the impact of selected parameters on the failure probability of a physical system. To this end, one can perform conditional reliability analysis, in which the probability of failure becomes a function of these parameters. Computing conditional reliability requires recomputing failure probabilities for a sample sequence of the parameters, which strongly increases the already high computational cost of conventional reliability analysis. We alleviate these costs by reusing information from previous reliability computations in each subsequent reliability analysis of the sequence. The method is designed using two variants of importance sampling and performs information transfer by reusing importance densities from previous reliability analyses in the current one. We put forward a criterion for selecting the most informative importance densities, which is robust with respect to the input space dimension, and use a recently proposed density mixture model for constructing effective importance densities in high dimensions. The method controls the estimator coefficient of variation to achieve a prescribed accuracy. We demonstrate its performance by means of two engineering examples featuring a number of pitfall features such as strong non-linearity, high dimensionality and small failure probabilities (10−5to10−9).}

Journal of Chemical Physics, 1953;21(6): 1087-1092). In the proposed methodology, samples are simulated as the states of a Markov chain and are distributed asymptotically according to the optimal importance sampling density. A kernel sampling density is then constructed from these samples which is used as the sampling density in an importance sampling simulation. The Markov chain samples populate the region of higher probability density in the failure region and so the kernel sampling density approximates the optimal importance sampling density for a large variety of shapes of the failure region. This adaptive feature is insensitive to the probability level to be estimated. A variety of numerical examples demonstrates the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the methodology.}

The approach overcomes the challenges associated with local optima pitfalls in processing the mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and hence determines the accurate solutions at modest computing efforts. In essence, the first-phase ESO design incorporates the constraint relaxations to fast eliminate the ineffective (infeasible) sections from initial discrete variable domains. This advantageously provides a significant reduction in the search spaces performed in the second-phase CLPSO scheme. The comprehensive learning technique enhances a standard particle swarm optimization algorithm by enabling the cooperative responses among swarm populations. The learning probability function defines the comprehensive cross-positions between the sets of best particles constructed from the reducing sets of steel sections specified in the preliminary ESO phase leading to the computation of optimal solutions. Various benchmarks (subjected to infinite design combinations) illustrate robustness and accuracy of the proposed design method (viz., generating the smaller number of particles) as compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms.},

The SS map outs the failure probability from the conditional samples constructed at each intermediate event. The proposed SS-CLPSO terminates the optimal solution to the RBDO problem as when the resulting failure probability converges to the permissible threshold. The applications of the present approach are illustrated through the steel truss design under probabilistic uncertain parameters and constraints.},

The method iteratively performs the CLPSO with deterministic parameters based on the most probable point (MPP) underpinning limit-state functions (LSFs) iteratively updated by the active learning reliability evaluation process. The GPR model approximates, from the design data given by CLPSO, the spectrum of LSFs under random parameters, and hence enables a significant computational reduction of Monte-Carlo simulations (MCSs) for failure probability approximation. The expected feasibility function is maximized using the CLPSO code to systematically refine the GPR model by adaptively adding new (intelligent) learning points in the region with high-reliability sensitivity leading to the more accurate prediction of failure probability. A novel inverse MCS constraint boundary method is developed to redefine the MPP assigned for the CLPSO algorithm in determining the new optimal design. The method efficiently leverages the decoupling approach, whilst significantly alleviating computing efforts, to quickly and accurately capture the optimal RBDO design. The resulting failure probability well satisfies the allowable limit. Four RBDO examples are provided to illustrate applications and robustness of the proposed decoupling GPR-CLPSO approach.}

The proposed procedure, herein called SS-KK, integrates the Kriging surrogate modeling technique, K-means clustering algorithm into the original Subset Simulation (SS) method. The approach is found to not only improve the efficiency of the Subset Simulation method in finding the reliability of a structural system but to also help identify the important failure modes and controlling random variables. This information is important to aid engineers optimize the structural design process by focusing on the critical failures modes and design variables. The method consists of first constructing a relatively coarse global Kriging model at each subset level of SS by applying an appropriate active learning strategy. Subsequently, the initial global Kriging model is partitioned into several local Kriging models that coincide with the important failure modes identified by the K-means clustering algorithm. This partitioning, which helps identify the important failure modes, also gives a better representation of the entire failure region leading to improved estimates of the system reliability. Finally, FORM is implemented for each local Kriging to rank the importance of each identified failure mode based on its Hasofer-Lind reliability index and to use the associated design point and sensitivity coefficients to identify the most critical random variables. Several examples extracted from the available literature are analyzed to illustrate the advantages of the proposed SS-KK methodology and demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency.}

The discussion presented is motivated by the identified spread and little interaction between metamodeling techniques in reliability, which makes it challenging for practitioners to decide which one to consider in a context of implementation. The conceptual problem of reliability analysis and the theoretical description of the four models is presented, and complemented by a comparative discussion of applications with identification of new areas of interest. The different considerations that influence the efficiency of adaptive metamodeling are reviewed, with extension to applicability discussions for the four models researched. Despite all adaptive techniques contributing to achieve significant gains in the amount of effort required for reliability analysis, and with minimal trade-off in accuracy, they should not be expected to perform equally in regard to the dependence on the reliability problem being addressed. Cross application of methodologies, bridging the gap between methodology and application, and ensembles are some of new areas of research interest identified. One of the major critical considerations for adaptive metamodeling, and that has been target of limited research, is the need for comprehensive techniques that allow a blind selection of the most adequate model with relation to the problem in–hand. To conclude, the extensive and comprehensive discussion presented aims to be a first step for the unification of the field of adaptive metamodeling in reliability; so that future implementations do not exclusively follow individual lines of research that progressively become more narrow in scope, but also seek transversal developments in the field of adaptive metamodeling for reliability analysis.}

This paper presents a review of the development and use of ML models in SRA. The review includes the most common types of ML methods used in SRA.

In this regard, the focus of the current manuscript is on the different models’ structures and diverse applications of each ML method in different aspects of SRA. Moreover, imperative considerations on the management of samples in the Monte Carlo simulation for SRA purposes and the treatment of the SRA problem as pattern recognition or classification task are provided.

In SALK, to select update points around the limit-state surfaces, three new system active learning functions are respectively defined for parallel, series and combined systems. The confidence interval of estimation of system failure probability at intermediate SRBDO solutions is considered in the stopping condition of Kriging update to reduce unnecessary update points used for refining the region far from the final SRBDO solution. Based on updated Kriging models, system failure probability is estimated by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and its partial derivative with respect to random variables is calculated by stochastic sensitivity analysis. The efficiency of the proposed SALK method for SRBDO is validated by four examples, including a power harvester design. The results indicate that SALK can locally approximate the limit-state surfaces around the final SRBDO solution and efficiently reduce the computational cost on the refinement of the region far from the final SRBDO solution.}

The performance of an active learning algorithm is determined by the utilized acquisition function, to a great extent, as it dominates the generation of the training data. The traditional acquisition functions usually fail to incorporate the spatial correlation information revealed by the surrogate model, thus still have plenty of room for improvement. We propose a new acquisition function, named as Expected Integrated Error Reduction (EIER) function, for active learning of the failure probability with a smaller number of simulator calls. Mathematically, the value of the EIER function at an unobserved point measures the expected integrated reduction of the probability of mis-classifying all points over the full input space, once this point is added to train the GPR model. The numerical error of the failure probability is evaluated with the posterior confidence intervals and/or coefficient of variation, numerically computed with an efficient sampling strategy, and is then served as the stopping criteria. The superiority of the proposed improvements is demonstrated with a set of numerical and engineering examples.}

The critical contribution of this work is the elegant implementation of the Kriging-based importance sampling and dimension reduction techniques within an active learning framework. Specifically, the proposed algorithm employs a dimension reduction technique that considers the contributions of important and unimportant random variables, enabling it to handle high-dimensional problems effectively. To exploit the merits of the adaptive Kriging method, a quasi-optimal importance sampling density is established based on the predictive information provided by the Kriging model. Additionally, a novel learning function allocation (LFA) strategy is proposed to automatically select the appropriate learning function from a portfolio of options. This facilitates the selection of new samples near the limit state surface with significant contributions to the failure probability. Moreover, an efficient stopping criterion is introduced to terminate the active learning process at an appropriate stage effectively. In other words, the proposed method inherits the merits of Adaptive Kriging, Dimension Reduction, and Importance Sampling, hence named AK-DRIS in this study.

These methods are designed by adaptively building an inexpensive surrogate of the original limit-state function. Examples of such surrogates include Gaussian process models which have been adopted in many contributions, the most popular ones being the efficient global reliability analysis (EGRA) and the active Kriging Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS), two milestone contributions in the field. In this paper, we first conduct a survey of the recent literature, showing that most of the proposed methods actually span from modifying one or more aspects of the two aforementioned methods. We then propose a generalized modular framework to build on-the-fly efficient active learning strategies by combining the following four ingredients or modules: surrogate model, reliability estimation algorithm, learning function and stopping criterion. Using this framework, we devise 39 strategies for the solution of 20 reliability benchmark problems. The results of this extensive benchmark (more than 12,000 reliability problems solved) are analyzed under various criteria leading to a synthesized set of recommendations for practitioners. These may be refined with a priori knowledge about the feature of the problem to solve, i.e. dimensionality and magnitude of the failure probability. This benchmark has eventually highlighted the importance of using surrogates in conjunction with sophisticated reliability estimation algorithms as a way to enhance the efficiency of the latter.}

Kriging-assisted RBDO methods can reduce the computational cost of conventional RBDO methods by replacing the time-consuming performance functions with Kriging models. Existing Kriging-assisted RBDO methods, however, are easy to fall into the low modeling efficiency issue or unsatisfied modeling accuracy issue because of the low utilization rate of sample resources. In this paper, an adaptive Kriging sampling strategy based on the Classification Uncertainty Quantification (KCUQ) was proposed. In KCUQ, the classification uncertainty of the Kriging model is sufficiently considered by (1) determining the new sample point based on the quantified misclassification probability and (2) checking the modeling accuracy based on the quantified number of misclassified random points. Moreover, KCUQ only updates the performance function with the largest classification error in each iteration such that all performance functions can be adaptively modeled based on their unique features. Two numerical case studies, vehicle side impact crashworthiness problem and the axle bridge turning parameters optimization application are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed KCUQ method.},

  abstract = {Reliability-based design approaches via scenario optimization are driven by data thereby eliminating the need for creating a probabilistic model of the uncertain parameters. A scenario approach not only yields a reliability-based design that is optimal for the existing data, but also a probabilistic certificate of its correctness against future data drawn from the same source. In this article, we seek designs that minimize not only the failure probability but also the risk measured by the expected severity of requirement violations. The resulting risk-based solution is equipped with a probabilistic certificate of correctness that depends on both the amount of data available and the complexity of the design architecture. This certificate is comprised of an upper and lower bound on the probability of exceeding a value-at-risk (quantile) level. A reliability interval can be easily derived by selecting a specific quantile value and it is mathematically guaranteed for any reliability constraints having a convex dependency on the decision variable, and an arbitrary dependency on the uncertain parameters. Furthermore, the proposed approach enables the analyst to mitigate the effect of outliers in the data set and to trade-off the reliability of competing requirements.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a decoupling approach for the efficient solution of Risk Optimization (RO) and Reliability Based Design Optimization (RBDO) problems. The proposed approach, SAP2nd, is a Sequential Approximate Programming (SAP) technique including second order terms obtained with the BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) approximation for the Hessian. A first advantage of SAP2nd is that any reliability analysis method can be employed for the evaluation of the probabilities of failure and its sensitivities. Here, Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is employed for this purpose. Several benchmark problems are solved to study the efficiency, robustness and accuracy of SAP2nd. It is demonstrated that the inclusion of second order terms leads to: (i) a much more stable algorithm in comparison to a first order SAP algorithm, i.e. it was able to avoid convergence issues arising from cycling, and (ii) a more efficient algorithm since SAP2nd reduced the computational effort, in both RO and RBDO problems, when compared to the coupled PCE algorithm previously proposed by the authors. The use of PCE for the evaluation of the probabilities of failure and its sensitivities allowed SAP2nd to achieve much more accurate results when compared to FORM based approaches, requiring the same order of computational effort. Finally, SAP2nd using PCE for reliability and sensitivity analysis is well suited for RO and RBDO problems where the drawbacks of FORM based approaches prevail, especially cases with highly nonlinear limit state function and non Gaussian random variables.},

In a Monte Carlo simulation, the performance function is calculated for all sampling points to determine the failure of the design.

In this study, a support vector machine was applied as a metamodel of the performance function to overcome this drawback. Kernel density and a modified margin of the support vector machine were used for the active learning of the support vector machine. The proportion of the support vector machine's modified margin in the design space was applied as the criterion to end active learning.

  abstract = {The enhanced weighted simulation-based design method in conjunction with particle swarm optimization (PSO) is developed as a pseudo double-loop algorithm for accurate reliability-based design optimization (RBDO). According to this hybrid method, generated samples of weighed simulation method (WSM) are considered as initial population of the PSO. The proposed population is then employed to evaluate the safety level of each PSO swarm (design candidates) during movement. Using this strategy, there is no required to conduct new sampling for reliability assessment of design candidates (PSO swarms). Employing PSO as the search engine of RBDO and WSM as the reliability analyzer provide more accurate results with few samples and also increase the application range of traditional WSM. Besides, a shift strategy is also introduced to increase the capability of the WSM to investigate general RBDO problems including both deterministic and random design variables. Several examples are investigated to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method. Results demonstrate the computational efficiency and superiority of the proposed method for practical engineering problems with highly nonlinear and implicit probabilistic constrains.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new framework for reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) using metaheuristic algorithms based on decoupled methods. The sequential optimization and reliability assessment (SORA) is utilized as a decoupled method in this study. In the present framework, unlike the previous RBDO based on decoupled methods, a metaheuristic is employed on both reliability assessment and the optimization parts. Here, first a new reliability assessment method based on the metaheuristics is introduced. Then, a new termination condition for the metaheuristic inspired by the termination condition of the gradient-based method is presented. In order to investigate the efficiency of the proposed framework, an enhanced shuffled shepherd optimization algorithm (ESSOA) is used as an optimization approach. The efficiency of the proposed framework is evaluated by four well-known RBDO benchmarks investigated in the previous studies using the gradient-based method. Also, the two new RBDO problems are introduced in this study. The results show that the proposed framework can have better performance than the gradient-based method in the RBDO and can easily be utilized in a wide range of RBDO problems.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient gradient-based optimization approach for reliability-based topology optimization of structures under uncertainties. Our objective is to find the optimized topology of structures with minimum weight which also satisfy certain reliability requirements. In the literature, those problems are primarily performed with approaches that use a first-order reliability method (FORM) to estimate the gradient of the probability of failure. However, these approaches may lead to deficient or even invalid results because the gradient of probabilistic constraints, calculated by first order approximation, might not be sufficiently accurate. To overcome this issue, a newly developed segmental multi-point linearization (SML) method is employed in the optimization approach for a more accurate estimation of the gradient of failure probability. Meanwhile, this implementation also improves the approximation of the probability evaluation at no extra cost. In general, adoption of the SML method leads to a more accurate and robust approach. Numerical examples show that the new approach, based on the SML method, is numerically stable and usually provides optimized structures that have more of the desired features than conventional FORM-based approaches. The present approach typically does not lead to a fully stressed design, and thus this feature will be verified by numerical examples.},
